### ideas/todo's
- way to add new viz's w/o coding new page (assuming i have support for the chart type / functionality)
- dynamically load the index w/ ^
- each viz is linkable

data is embedded in each canvas as a data attribute
custom js lib reads all the attributes and does magic

also have worker app which can run different tasks at various intervals
